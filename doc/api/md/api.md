      "title":"Title:"Knowing value" logic as a normal modal logic",
        "authors":"Tao GuYanjing Wang",
        "abstruct":"Abstract: Recent years witness a growing interest in nonstandard epistemic logics of"knowing whether", "knowing what", "knowing how" and so on. These logics areusually not normal, i.e., the standard axioms and reasoning rules for modallogic may be invalid. In this paper, we show that the conditional "knowingvalue" logic proposed by Wang and Fan (2013) can be viewed as a disguisednormal modal logic by treating the negation of Kv operator as a specialdiamond. Under this perspective, it turns out that the original first-orderKripke semantics can be greatly simplified by introducing a ternary relation$R_i^c$ in standard Kripke models which associates one world with two$i$-accessible worlds that do not agree on the value of constant $c$. Underintuitive constraints, the modal logic based on such Kripke models is exactlythe one studied by Wang and Fan (2013,2014). Moreover, there is a very naturalbinary generalizations of the "knowing value" diamond, which, surprisingly,does not increase the expressive power of the logic. The resulting logic withthe binary diamond has a transparent normal modal system which sharpens ourunderstanding of the "knowing value" logic and simplifies some previous hardproblems.",
